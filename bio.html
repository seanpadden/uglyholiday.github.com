        <font face="copperplate gothic bold" color="00FF00" font size="5"><b>It was 2002 when we first met. Thanksgiving was the day and Christmas was right around the bend. The rave we found ourselves at had a bathroom you would not believe. We three stood in line for the men's room face painting booth. It was there that we bonded over our general disgust at the upcoming holidays. Jesse was horribly offended by the monstrosities of organized religion and detested that they should have massive holidays in their name. Sean was sickened by the infectious disease of capitalism that poisons the hearts and souls of the public and the amorality of the system that consumes and corrupts the land. Dick had just been released from the orphanage he'd grown up in and was at ends with his view of the world in the wake of the WCW Invasion storyline of the WWF, effectively ending the Attitude era. The world was a mess, but we three young men took our negative dispositions and flipped them upside down. We said "Yo, Satan, dude, give us the the strength to overcome our setbacks. Give us talent to form a groundbreaking, earth shattering band". And he did so. We each got our faces painted to resemble a different ghoul and gained world powers and formed that soul crushing band. Our first album went double platinum. We were awarded the Purple Heart Medal of Horror. And that's all I have to say about that.</b></h2>
